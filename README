NAME

    Graphics::TIFF - Perl extension for the libtiff library

VERSION

    16

SYNOPSIS

    Perl bindings for the libtiff library. This module allows you to access
    TIFF images in a Perlish and object-oriented way, freeing you from the
    casting and memory management in C, yet remaining very close in spirit
    to original API.

    The following snippet can be used to read the image data from a TIFF:

     use Graphics::TIFF ':all';
     my $tif = Graphics::TIFF->Open( 'test.tif', 'r' );
     my $stripsize = $tif->StripSize;
     for my $stripnum ( 0 .. $tif->NumberOfStrips - 1 ) {
         my $buffer = $tif->ReadEncodedStrip( $stripnum, $stripsize );
         # do something with $buffer
     }
     $tif->Close;

DESCRIPTION

    The Graphics::TIFF module allows a Perl developer to access TIFF
    images. Find out more about libtiff at http://www.libtiff.org.

DIAGNOSTICS

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

DEPENDENCIES

 Runtime

    The runtime dependencies are just libtiff itself. In Windows this is
    satisfied by Alien::libtiff.

 Build

    The build dependencies are additionally the development headers for
    libtiff and Perl.

 Test

    In addition to the above, the Perl module Image::Magick is required to
    run some of the tests.

INCOMPATIBILITIES

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

SEE ALSO

    The LIBTIFF Standard Reference http://www.libtiff.org/libtiff.html is a
    handy companion. The Perl bindings follow the C API very closely, and
    the C reference documentation should be considered the canonical
    source.
